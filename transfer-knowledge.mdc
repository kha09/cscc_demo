Caused by:
    Syntax Error
```

## Root Cause

The error is occurring because the file is incomplete and has unclosed JSX tags. The file appears to be truncated at the end, specifically at a `<Button variant="ghost"` line. This is causing the JSX parser to get confused because it's expecting proper closing tags for all opened elements.

The specific error message points to line 418-420, where there's an issue with the JSX structure. The parser is expecting a JSX identifier after the opening `<div>` tag, but it's finding something unexpected.

## Solution

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that all JSX tags in the file are properly closed. Here are the steps to fix it:

1. Open the file `app/department-manager/page.tsx`
2. Check for any unclosed JSX tags throughout the file
3. Pay special attention to the end of the file, which appears to be truncated
4. Make sure all opening tags have corresponding closing tags
5. Ensure proper nesting of JSX elements

Here's a checklist of JSX elements that need to be properly closed:
- `<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50 font-sans" dir="rtl">` needs a closing `</div>`
- `<header>` needs a closing `</header>`
- `<main>` needs a closing `</main>`
- `<Card>` needs a closing `</Card>`
- `<table>` needs a closing `</table>`
- `<tbody>` needs a closing `</tbody>`
- `<React.Fragment>` needs a closing `</React.Fragment>`
- `<tr>` needs a closing `</tr>`
- `<td>` needs a closing `</td>`
- Any `<Button>` tags need closing `</Button>` tags

The file appears to be truncated at a `<Button variant="ghost"` line, so you'll need to complete this button tag and ensure all subsequent JSX elements are properly closed.

## Specific Fix for the Current Error

For the specific error at lines 418-420, check if there's any issue with the JSX structure in the header section. Make sure there are no unexpected characters or comments that might be interfering with the JSX parsing.

Here's how the header section should look:

```jsx
{/* Header */}
<header className="w-full bg-slate-900 text-white py-3 px-6 sticky top-0 z-10">
  <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto flex items-center justify-between">
    {/* Logo and Title - Right Side */}
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2 font-bold text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
      {/* ... rest of header content ... */}
    </div>
    {/* ... rest of header content ... */}
  </div>
</header>
```

## Fixing the Truncated File

If the file is truncated, you'll need to restore the missing content. Here's a general structure for how the end of the file should look:

```jsx
{/* ... existing content ... */}
<Button variant="ghost" size="sm" onClick={() => toggleTaskExpansion(task.id)}>
  {expandedTasks.has(task.id) ? (
    <ChevronUp className="h-4 w-4" />
  ) : (
    <ChevronDown className="h-4 w-4" />
  )}
</Button>
{/* ... rest of content ... */}
</td>
</tr>
{/* ... rest of content ... */}
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</Card>
{/* ... rest of content ... */}
</div>
</main>
</div>
);
}
```

## Why This Works

JSX requires that all tags be properly closed and nested. By ensuring that each opening tag has a corresponding closing tag and that the nesting is correct, you'll fix the syntax error that's causing the build to fail.

## Additional Notes

- This is a common issue in JSX when files are large and complex
- Always ensure that JSX tags are properly closed and nested
- Use an editor with JSX/React support to help identify unclosed tags
- Consider breaking large components into smaller, more manageable components

After making these changes, the build should compile successfully.
